Neural Time Series Analysis
---
## Introduction
There has been a great development in time series forecasting using neural network. We have seen many models from seq2seq to wavenet. 
Yet I struggle to find something simple to use, comprehnsive and flexible for 1D time series regression. So I built one.

This library is a collection of recent models for 1D time-series forecast, either 1 step, multi-step and auto-regressive.

The models are not all mine. Wavenet credits goes to [Sean Vasquez](https://github.com/sjvasquez/) and the Neural Process implementation is inspired by [Kaspar MÃ¤rtens](https://github.com/kasparmartens/). They did an amazing job, thank you guys!

This repo is still under development and the code is poorely commented, just open an issue or ping me directly.

## Features

1. Recurrent models can use the Input Attention mechanism as developed in the DARNN paper, to increate interpretability in case of high-dimensional feature space.
2. Neural Processes in the regression setting, can provide mean and variance for each estimate.
3. Each model can be used in an autoregressive setting

Check nb/ for detailed description.
